                <p>Hello! My name is Talmage Trebilcock. I am from the state of Georgia in the United States of America. I enjoy camping, hiking, and obviously computers. I am currently waiting on my mission call and plan to leave hopefully leave on my mission sometime after this semester ends. I am currently talking all online classes while I prepare to go on my mission. I have previously taken a class that taught basic web development all the way back in middle school however, this class did not go that much in depth into web design. I am excited to finally be revisiting web design and development so that I can learn even more about web development and everything that it has to offer. I have never had much of an interest in web design or any specific area of computer science before, however, my brother, who has already graduated from Brigham Young University Idaho is currently focusing on and working in web development so I think that i could potentially ask him about some web development things and maybe even get some tips on how I can improve my own web development.</p>

                <P>Georgia is a state in the south United States. It has the best quality roads in the entire country. It is also home to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport which is the busiest airport in the world. Georgia has also been growing in the film industry lately with many films being filmed on location within the state.</P>
